These are the installation instructions for OSWAL. See README for more
information.

Build the executables (main and loader) using
	make
and put them into your cgi-bin/ (or similar) directory. Add an
oswal.conf file in the same directory and template files and modules
where appropriate.

EOF (yes, it's that simple).
