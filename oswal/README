OSWAL - OSWAL Systems Watch And Log

OSWAL is a utility which provides system information via HTTP. It
requires a CGI-capable web server.

This is a very early release of OSWAL, which means that there are lots
of bugs left for the user to discover.

Build requirements:
- gcc 3 (or any similar C compiler and linker),
- bison,
- flex (version 2.5.4 or similar; version 2.5.31 is buggy) and
- libxml2 (with the xml-config script in your PATH).

See INSTALL for instructions regarding installation.

An example set of configuration data is available from the OSWAL
homepage, http://oswal.berlios.de/, in the file sample1.tar.gz.

OSWAL is GPLed. See Copying for details. The developers can be contacted
via electronic mail at oswal-devel@lists.berlios.de .
